# Erdos-Institute-Quant-Finance-Mini-Projects
This is a compilation of all the mini-projects I completed using Python for the Erdos Institute Quantitative Finance program. Each project explores a fundamental aspect of the quantitative finance world:

Project 1: Portfolio Construction

Focused on building an optimized portfolio under specific criteria.
Considered both expected return and volatility for optimization.


Project 2: Financial Asset Movement Assumptions

Studied basic assumptions about financial asset movements.
Laid the foundation for developing more sophisticated mathematical models.


Project 3: Black-Scholes Model and Greeks

Explored and visualized key derived quantities (Greeks) of the Black-Scholes model.
Focused on option pricing and its fundamental components.


Project 4: Exotic Volatility Model and Option Pricing

Analyzed an underlying stock with an exotic volatility model.
Proposed a model to price options and conducted delta hedging.
Performed numerical experiments to validate the proposed model.
