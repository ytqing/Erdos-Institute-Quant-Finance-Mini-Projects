    "In the theory of mathematical finance, it is common to assume the log returns of a stock/index are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate if the log returns of stocks or indexes of your choosing are normally distributed. Some suggestions for exploration include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Test if there are period of times when the log-returns of a stock/index have evidence of normal distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Test if removing extremal return data creates a distribution with evidence of being normal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Create a personalized portfolio of stocks with historical log return data that is normally distributed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4) Test if the portfolio you created in the first mini-project has significant periods of time with evidence of normally distributed log returns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5) Gather x-number of historical stock data and just perform a normality test on their log return data to see if any of the stocks exhibit evidence of log returns that are normally distributed."
